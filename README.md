My name is Jacek and I am programmer specialized mainly in C# (but use and like other languages too!)
<br>
I'm into writing math applications or algorithms based on nature.

In my free time I love:
* doing sports 💪 (especially capoeira 🤸‍♂️ and bike 🚴‍♂️)
* playing computer games 🎮
* reading books 📚
* listening to music 🎵 
* meeting with friends 🍻
